# -NLP-sentiment-analysis-mini-project
This project introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals by performing text cleaning, preprocessing, and vectorization on customer review data. The goal is to build a sentiment classification model that automatically identifies whether a review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
📌 Project Overview
This project introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP) fundamentals by performing text cleaning, preprocessing, and vectorization on customer review data. The goal is to build a sentiment classification model that automatically identifies whether a review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

💼 Business Context
In e-commerce, customer reviews directly impact buying decisions. With increasing feedback volume, manual monitoring is unsustainable.
This project demonstrates how NLP + Machine Learning can help businesses:

Detect complaints early and reduce churn
Improve customer experience and retention
Maintain strong brand reputation
Extract actionable insights from customer feedback
📊 Dataset
Product ID → Unique identifier for each product
Product Review → Customer feedback text
Sentiment → Label (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
⚙️ Project Workflow
